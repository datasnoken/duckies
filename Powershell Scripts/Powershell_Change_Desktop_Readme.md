# Change Desktop Readme
Paste the script on pastebin (is sometimes blocked on company network), or like I do; on github.

**CHANGE LINE 2 TO THE PICTURE YOU WANT AS THE NEW BACKGROUND**


View the script as 'raw' and paste the link in line 30 of the arduino_run_script_from_web script, where it says "YOUR_SCRIPT_HOSTED_ON_SOME_SITE_AS_RAW"
